# plymouth-owl
open source repo for University of Plymouth OWL project
developed by Phil Culverhouse, Centre for Robotics & Neural Systems, University of Plymouth, Plymouth PL4 8AA
for teaching Robotics and Vision systems using OpenCV v3.4.3 and above
for teaching stereo vision techniques using two steerable cameras, 
including
1) Servo calibration
2) Camera calibration for both intrinsics and extrinsics 
3) Verged vision target tracking and distance estimation using steerable cameras
4) Rectified stereo pairs from fixed cameras
5) Stereo depth estimation using disparity 
6) Cognitive modelling of eye saccades, developing a simplified model after Itt & Koch

resources include
a) a basic servo/camera system for verged camera tracking
b) a basic fixed camera pair using
c) a user guide on the hardware/software of the OWL
d) full CAD drawings for mechanical and electronics of the OWL
e) example videos for disparity calibration and matching, and for saliency model implementation
